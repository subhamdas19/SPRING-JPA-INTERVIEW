    @Basic signifies that an attribute is to be persisted and a standard mapping is to be used. It has parameters which allow you to specify whether the attribute is to be lazily loaded and whether it's nullable.

    @Column allows you to specify the name of the column in the database to which the attribute is to be persisted.

If you specify one without the other then you get default behaviour which is sensible, so commonly folks use only one with the exception of special cases.

So if we wanted a lazy loading of an attribute and to specify a column name we can say

 @Basic(fetch=FetchType.LAZY)
 @Column(name="WIBBLE")

If we neeed the default, non-lazy behaviour then just the @Column would have been sufficient.





I have Table User in SQL Server DB with close to 30 columns. I have also created an JPA Entity for corresponding DB Table. The JPA entity looks something like this:

@Entity
@Table(name="USER")
@Setter
@Getter
public class User{

@Id
@Column(name="ID",nullable=false)
private Integer id;

@Column(name="NAME")
private String name;

@Column(name="ADDRESS")
private String address;

@Column(name="FATHER_NAME")
private String fathersName;

}

Now I am trying to create a native query which will only fetch id and name from the User Table. 

You can define additional constructor for the User entity:

@Entity
@Table(name="USER")
public class User {

   public User(){
   }

   public User(Integer id, String name){
      this.id = id;
      this.name = name;
   }

   // ...
}

and then write the following query:

@Query("select new your.package.User(u.id, u.name) from User u")
List<User> fetchUser();

Note that this is not native, but jpql query.

So let's say I have two tables called student and class. class id is a foreign key in student table. The class id column for some students might also be empty (means no class is assigned to them). If we use spring jpa to fetch data for such students, then the class entity object would be null. I would rather want an empty object instead of null so that manual null checks are avoided. How do I achieve this?

Student Entity - Student Id, Name, Age, Class Id
Class Entity - Class Id, Class Name, Appointed Teacher Name


Anyhow you endup with a direct or in-direct manual check.

Fetching records as java 8 optional would help.

When you use field-type access, you can implement the getter and setter methods in your own way. You can, for example, implement a getMyValue() method which wraps the myValue attribute in an Optional

@Entity
public class SomeClass {

...

@Column
private String myValue;

 ...

 public Optional getMyValue() {
    return Optional.ofNullable(myValue);
 }

 public void setMyValue(LocalDate myValue) {
    this.myValue= myValue;
 }
...
